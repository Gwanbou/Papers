- Pre-training model of visual document understanding (VDU).
- ViTLP predicts both document texts and layouts (text-layout sequence).
- Given a document image, the model optimizes hierarchical language and layout modeling objectives to generate the interleaved text and layout sequence.
- ViTLP can function as a native OCR model to localize and recognize texts of document images.
- Experiments show that ViTLP achieves competitive performance over existing baselines on benchmark VDU tasks, including information extraction, document classification, and document question answering.
